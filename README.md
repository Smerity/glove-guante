# Guante: Exploring GloVe

This repository contains various explorations into the [GloVe: Global Vectors for Word Representation](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), the work of Pennington, Socher, and Manning.
Most of this will focus on the models produced by their existing codebase.

Guante is Spanish for glove.
Quite unexpected, right?
